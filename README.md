Doing this just for the fun of it, the objective is to make a working program that can tell the pok√©mon's weakness (when defending) and then making a good looking GUI.
Since this is my 1st real project (besides all of my failed tries of making a game in C#) it's still full of bugs and inconsistencies. If you enconter any issues please tell me :D
